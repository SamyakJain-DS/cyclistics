avg length of a ride is 15:06
max length of a ride is 06:50:31 ,by a casual member
mode length of a ride is 00:06:00

difference in duration
avg duration of a casual is 22 mins 03 secs
avg duration of a member is 11 mins 36 secs

this shows that a casual member, on an average is riding longer than a member of the company,
which shows the need of the service.

difference in no of trips taken
no. of trips taken by members is close to double that of the casuals
no of trips increased after people bought memberships

difference in the weekdays when the trips are taken
On the fridays,saturdays and sundays, the difference multiplier between the
casuals and members drops below that of total rides taken.
implying, that on fridays,saturdays and sundays members are less likely to rent a bike
whereas casuals are more likely to use bikes on weekends
one implication of this data can be that office workers or college students usually need memberships
to attend their offices or institutions on the weekdays
the difference is highest on tuesdays, 2.6x compared to the total's difference multiplier of 2.0x

one thing to note about duration of trips is that casuals usually take bikes for longer trips
while members are more flexible in their usage, and use bikes for shorter durations on an average

IN TOTAL, members have used the bike for 4214.2 Days,whereas Casuals have used them for
4031.5 Days , making a difference of almost 200 days worth of time.

onto our season analysis,
its noted that members use bikes WAY MORE than casuals in the winter seasons,
whereas the difference multiplier in hotter months is equal or lower than the total difference multiplier.
in winters, the difference multiplier goes all the way up to 3.7x, compared the to total multiplier which is 2.0x
One way to asses this information could be that in winters, people buy membership to stay warm and fit.
or that people just dont prefer using bikes in hot months, probably due to better alternatives like car, which can keep them cool while driving.
